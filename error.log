Went through hashing to ensure the files are properly received. I also searched for ways to modify MQTT server (mosquitto) to whitelist users on topic by ip address (that is updates can only be posted from a fixed IP) <- this does not seem to be an option mosquitto offers.\\r\\nI have decided on a protocol:\\r\\nWe issue an update command (telling the unit to update itself). When the unit is told to update, it fetches code from a fixed server URL (www.backoffice.com/monitoring_unit_update.lua). This puts the responsibility of security on the server-side of the application where malicious code can only be added to the system if the server is compromised. This prevents upload of malicious code on units as someone can steal a unit - see the username and passwd of the mqtt broker, and send whatever code they want the unit to execute to all units (by bruteforcing topics).'),

Went through hashing to ensure the files are properly received. I also searched for ways to modify MQTT server (mosquitto) to whitelist users on topic by ip address (that is updates can only be posted from a fixed IP) <- this does not seem to be an option mosquitto offers.\\r\\nI have decided on a protocol:\\r\\nWe issue an update command (telling the unit to update itself). When the unit is told to update, it fetches code from a fixed server URL (www.backoffice.com/monitoring_unit_update.lua). This puts the responsibility of security on the server-side of the application where malicious code can only be added to the system if the server is compromised. This prevents upload of malicious code on units as someone can steal a unit - see the username and passwd of the mqtt broker, and send whatever code they want the unit to execute to all units (by bruteforcing topics).'),
