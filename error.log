Change needs to be made in config file + html file to save this to config file. Then main.lua needs to be changed to check the value for this control pin to determine what part of the circuit to power for counting. Then adding a condition to the interrupt section so it checks if right pin is on\\r\\nThoughts : I was considering using the in/Out pins to determine whether machine lost power - this would prevent an incorrect count of 1 from happening (as they both went low). What would happen if this was attached to BV where only BV pin is being listened to.. i.e how do I detect power outage when I dont have a condition that makes me recognize power outage and counting by 1 incorrectly?
